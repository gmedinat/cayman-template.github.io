## About Me
I am an Arts & Science Postdoctoral Fellow at the David A. Dunlap Department of Astronomy & Astrophysics, [University of Toronto](https://www.astro.utoronto.ca/people/post-docs/name/gustavo-medina/) in Canada. I completed my doctoral studies (Dr.rer.nat) in 2022 at the Astronomisches Rechen-Institut (ARI) at the [University of Heidelberg](https://www.imprs-hd.mpg.de/5699/Alumni) in Germany, working under the supervision of Prof. Eva K. Grebel ([PhD Thesis](https://www.imprs-hd.mpg.de/480995/thesis_Medina2.pdf)). Before that, I obtained my Master of Science and Bachelor of Science degrees at [Universidad de Chile](http://www.das.uchile.cl/das_int_alumnosM_ex.html) (in 2017 and 2014, respectively), the formed supervised by Prof. Ricardo Munoz ([Master Thesis](https://repositorio.uchile.cl/handle/2250/149094)).

My research focuses on Galactic archaeology and the use of pulsating variable stars as tracers of the formation and evolution of the Milky Way, with an emphasis on RR Lyrae stars. These stars well-known old and metal-poor distance indicators, ubiquitous in the Galactic halo, dwarf galaxies, and globular clusters. I have specialized on the study of the outer halo. I am the Principal Investigator of the Halo Outskirts with Variable STars (HOWVAST) survey (Medina et al. 2021b), which was used to identify and characterize photometrically and spectroscopically RR Lyrae stars in the distant halo, with distances of 5-300 kpc from the center of the Milky Way. With this survey, we studied the radial density profile of the Galaxy out to its outermost regions to link observations with galaxy formation models (Medina et al. 2024), and carried out a pilot spectroscopic follow up to connect these stars with outer halo substructures and to understand the limitations of current and upcoming spectroscopic surveys (Medina et al. 2023). I have also studied classical Cepheids to constrain their fundamental properties and the physics ruling the disruption of open clusters (Medina et al. 2021a).

the main responsible for the analysis of RR Lyrae stars in DESI and S5.
