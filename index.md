## About Me
I am an Arts & Science Postdoctoral Fellow at the David A. Dunlap Department of Astronomy & Astrophysics, [University of Toronto](https://www.astro.utoronto.ca/people/post-docs/name/gustavo-medina/) in Canada. I completed my doctoral studies (Dr.rer.nat) in 2022 at the Astronomisches Rechen-Institut (ARI) at the [University of Heidelberg](https://www.imprs-hd.mpg.de/5699/Alumni) in Germany, working under the supervision of Prof. Eva K. Grebel ([PhD Thesis](https://www.imprs-hd.mpg.de/480995/thesis_Medina2.pdf): "Unveiling the Milky Wayâ€™s History Using Young & Old Population Variable Stars"). Before that, I obtained my Master of Science (MSc) and Bachelor of Science (BSc) degrees at [Universidad de Chile](http://www.das.uchile.cl/das_int_alumnosM_ex.html) (in 2017 and 2014, respectively), the formed supervised by Prof. Ricardo Munoz ([MSc Thesis](https://repositorio.uchile.cl/handle/2250/149094): "Searching for distant RR Lyrae in the Galactic halo using the High cadence Transient Survey").


My research focuses on Galactic archaeology and the use of pulsating variable stars as tracers of the formation and evolution of the Milky Way.
I am the Principal Investigator of the Halo Outskirts With VAriable STars (HOWVAST) survey, which aims to explore the outermost regions of the Milky Way using RR Lyrae stars, and to use them for Galactic archaeology.
Key to this endeavor is the study of the positions and chemo-dynamics of RR Lyrae stars, which I have conducted using dedicated photometric and spectroscopic observational campaigns. Moreover, I am involved in the development of several large-scale surveys. For instance, I am the main responsible for assembling the RR Lyrae star catalog in the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Survey ([DESI](https://www.desi.lbl.gov/the-desi-survey/)) and the Southern Stellar Stream Spectroscopic Survey ([S5](https://s5collab.github.io/)), and for developing pipelines for their spectroscopic characterization. Furthermore, I am an active contributor to the DECam Local Volume Exploration Survey ([DELVE](https://delve-survey.github.io/)), where I serve as a coordinator of the WIDE subgroup.
