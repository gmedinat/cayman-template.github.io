## About Me
I am an Arts & Science Postdoctoral Fellow at the David A. Dunlap Department of Astronomy & Astrophysics, [University of Toronto](https://www.astro.utoronto.ca/people/post-docs/name/gustavo-medina/) in Canada. I completed my doctoral studies (Dr.rer.nat) in 2022 at the Astronomisches Rechen-Institut (ARI) at the [University of Heidelberg](https://www.imprs-hd.mpg.de/5699/Alumni) in Germany, working under the supervision of Prof. Eva K. Grebel ([PhD Thesis](https://www.imprs-hd.mpg.de/480995/thesis_Medina2.pdf): "Unveiling the Milky Wayâ€™s History Using Young & Old Population Variable Stars"). Before that, I obtained my Master of Science (MSc) and Bachelor of Science (BSc) degrees at [Universidad de Chile](http://www.das.uchile.cl/das_int_alumnosM_ex.html) (in 2017 and 2014, respectively), the formed supervised by Prof. Ricardo Munoz ([MSc Thesis](https://repositorio.uchile.cl/handle/2250/149094): "Searching for distant RR Lyrae in the Galactic halo using the High cadence Transient Survey").


My research focuses on Galactic archaeology and the use of pulsating variable stars as tracers of the formation and evolution of the Milky Way.
I am the Principal Investigator of the Halo Outskirts With VAriable STars (HOWVAST) survey, which aims to explore the outermost regions of the Milky Way using RR Lyrae stars, and to use them for Galactic archaeology.
Key to this endeavor is the study of the positions and chemo-dynamics of RR Lyrae stars, which I have conducted using dedicated photometric and spectroscopic observational campaigns. Moreover, I am involved in the development of several large-scale surveys. For instance, I am the main responsible for assembling the RR Lyrae star catalog in the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Survey ([DESI](https://www.desi.lbl.gov/the-desi-survey/)) and the Southern Stellar Stream Spectroscopic Survey ([S5](https://s5collab.github.io/)), and for developing pipelines for their spectroscopic characterization. Furthermore, I am an active contributor to the DECam Local Volume Exploration Survey ([DELVE](https://delve-survey.github.io/)), where I serve as a coordinator of the WIDE subgroup.

    <p>
        Here is some information about the galactic map. The text here should be on the right half of the webpage, while the image is on the left. I'm hoping to make this paragraph pretty long to show how it might look if you have a lot to say about it. Of course, you don't have to be talking about the image at all here, you could talk about how cool you are and just have this image because it's pretty and is a kinda nice intro to what your work focuses on.
    </p>
</div>

In here, I'm going to put some words so that we can see what it will look like to have long paragraphs in between images! I think you should have a picture of yourself in the about me section. I know it's kinda controversial, so maybe you don't put it on the front page, but hidden in one of the other tabs if I can get those working. It would be perfect if you had a candid shot of you working or presenting or something so that maybe the focus isn't just on showing your face. But a lot of university faculty sites have pictures of the professors! It just adds a little familiarity to remind the people reading it that they are affecting the life of a real person. Also, you are kinda recognizable haha, so maybe there's someone that's seen you, but doesn't know your name!

        This image shows the halo profile. At least, that's what the title says. I don't really know what the rest of the words in the file name mean, but I bet you do! anyways, here's another block of text so we can see that this time, the image is on the right side and the test is on the left. I hope this all is working. using html here is bringing me back to my Neopets days, when I first figured out coding so I could customize my neopet's profiles haha. I was such a nerd.

    <p>
        The two plots here have shading without sex...tractor? I'm trying to decipher these titles but I don't know anything haha. Anyways, you are awesome and are doing so much! I hope this website helps show people all the things you do! It would be really cool for you to have a place to talk about some of the things you've done that don't really have a place anywhere in your applications. If you talk candidly about some of your outreach things in Chile, or side stuff you've done at UT, I bet people would read it and see a bit more of your personality so they could decide if you'd be a good match for their programs or not. I love you!
